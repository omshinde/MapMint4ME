/* This sketch is used for calibrating the Gas and Smoke sensor
 * The sensor is connected to Arduino Uno via WEATHERSHIELD developed by SYSLAB. 
 * Added in August 2017 for SOS input support.
 * The Ro value after calibrating came equal to 3.63 KOhm.

Remarks: The sensor and the load resistor forms a voltage divider. Given the voltage
         across the load resistor and its resistance, the resistance of the sensor
         could be derived.

Remarks: This function assumes that the sensor is in clean air. It use

         and then divides it with RO_CLEAN_AIR_FACTOR. RO_CLEAN_AIR_FACTOR is about
